# ChatVoicePlayer
An Android library to make the implementation of voice/audio messages' playing easier (SDK 16+)

# Why to use this library? 
- To avoid the unwanted errors of using MediaPlayer in Android
- This is a ready-to-use component to use in playing the chat voice message in chat applications or any other app

# Features
- Extremely easy to use
- Direct share of the audio file
- Full control of customization (colors, visibilities, shapes) 
- The controls are availabe in XML and programmatically

# Installation
Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
Step 2. Add the dependency

	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.JagarYousef:ChatVoicePlayer:1.0.1'
	}

# Usage
1. Add the voice player view in your xml layout: 
```
<me.jagar.chatvoiceplayerlibrary.VoicePlayerView
    android:id="@+id/voicePlayerView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:playPauseBackgroundColor="#4CAF50"
    app:shareBackgroundColor="#F44336"
    app:viewBackground="@color/gray"
    app:showShareButton="true"
    app:shareCornerRadius="100"
    app:playPauseCornerRadius="100"
    app:showTiming="false"
    app:viewCornerRadius="100"
    app:progressTimeColor="@color/pink"
    app:seekBarThumbColor="#FFC107"
    app:seekBarProgressColor="#000"
    app:shareText="SHARE ME"/>
```
2. Now prepare your player view wherever you want in your activity: 
```
voicePlayerView.setAudio(AUDIO_FILE_PATH);
```

* **NOTE:** Make sure to allow READ & WRITE external storage permessions
